== ideas
Can drop naturally to untyped Any, even removing type
goto methods, unscoped methoeds?
COMEFROM, and auto debugger?
monads = type in = type out? Or bind. And construction/'unit' funcs
...or define chains of expressinfg actions. As opposed to iterators, and short cuircuits? How is a short circuit in Haskel? How to do that in LISP notation?
literate programming switch and converter
genrics, defo
options, yes! and other types. Checked and optomising unchecked.
not nested classes, but an indication/annotation for nesting (what about complementary objects? So use naming?)
The above also suggests using function calls for 'else' in if/else
TempleOS documentation?
if can only use else with method?
Converters from C and Python
Nice if ''from, to, until' not keywords
Yes to camelCase
Scala type testing. Ans please, please, let me RUN it.
If we do get a true converter, how about a Python-maintained second version, for general use?
Most good code has a logger... whats the difference t a printer? Should it be in libraries? Should it be built in?

== Design
1 Python not Ruby
2 lexer
3 parser
4 parser with tree
5 symbols/atoms shou;ld be tree units


== Literals
Enums can be done by symbol vals in a namespace?
Codepoints, do we need them? Set them by an imported Enum if needed.

== Operators

> greater
>> move left
>>> type?

! not

= eq
== allocate
=== type?

+ - * %
+ add
++ inc

- minus
-- dec

* multiply
** power

% divide
%% power -1

index???

## grammar
parameter definitions take new symbols for use within. Parameter usage takes existing symbols for specialization of the contents.

def zaa!(): int
   ...
end

Short for e.g.

def (zaa!(): int (
   ...
)
)

as is

val zee! 88

short for e.g.

val (zee!(): int (88))
